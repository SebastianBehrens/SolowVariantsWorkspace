              <div style="height:2vh"></div>
              <p>This app provides a playground to quickly simulate various variants of growth models that have been modelled after the groundbreaking and Noble-price winnning growth model of Robert Solow. Head to the menubar on the left and see for yourself.</p>
              <p>If you want to use the underlying code to simulate the models to play around more, check out the R package <a href="https://github.com/SebastianBehrens/SolowVariants"> here</a>.</p>
              <div style="height:2vh"></div>
              <p>For any in-depth explanations on most of the models simulated in this app, refer to the book <a href="https://swisscovery.slsp.ch/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991170526913405501&context=L&vid=41SLSP_NETWORK:VU1_UNION&lang=de&search_scope=DN_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=41SLSP_NETWORK&query=any,contains,Introducing%20Advanced%20Macroeconomics:%20Growth%20and%20Business%20Cycles%20by%20Sorensen%20and%20Whitta-Jacobsen&sortby=date_d&facet=frbrgroupid,include,9040471419498156407&offset=0">Introducing Advanced Macroeconomics: Growth and Business Cycles by Sorensen and Whitta-Jacobsen</a>.</p>
